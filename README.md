=========================
This is an interactive system that converts body movement tracked by an Xbox Kinect 1 and visualizes it into notes and sounds using the Processing IDE.
It was featured at the Toronto Nuit Blanche festival in 2014 at the Wychwood Barns.
This project was created by Nabil Babu and Chris Elcombe
